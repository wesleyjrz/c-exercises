/*
 * NOTE: You must know that I spent almost a month trying to make this shit
 * work! The book says it must print "...as much as possible of the text..."
 * and also shows "...the length of arbitrarily long input lines..." but it's
 * impossible to do both changing only "the main routine", today when I finally
 * found a way to print lines longer than the MAX defined limit my program was
 * buggy and it just didn't look right, so I decided to do more research about
 * this exercise (and yes, I already did this before, so many times).
 *
 * I finally found out what the autor was trying to say with "as much as
 * possible", thank you Kernighan and Ritchie for making me learn by suffer!
